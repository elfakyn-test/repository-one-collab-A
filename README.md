This readme is far from polished. Sorry :(

Board game. Players take turns placing tokens on a (default 8x8) board.

When a player places tokens on all 4 corners of a square, they receive points according to the size of the square and angle of the square with respect to the board. The bigger the square, the higher the points. The more angled the square, the higher the points.

First person to reach (default 150) points with at least (default 15) points ahead wins.
